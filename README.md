# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a webpage or application interface. It is typically a low-fidelity sketch or blueprint that outlines key elements such as headers, buttons, images, and navigation menusâ€”without focusing on design details like colors or fonts.

## Importance in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the early stages of the design process. It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders:

- **Visualize the layout and user flow** before development begins.
- **Identify usability issues** and improve user experience (UX) early on.
- **Facilitate communication and collaboration** among team members.
- **Save time and resources** by allowing quick changes before final design and development.

By serving as a foundation, wireframes ensure that the end product aligns with user needs and project goals.
